1. Goals and Background Context

1.1 Goals

Rhythm Precision Assurance: Provide WordPress developers with the ability to check 14px grid alignment (vertical and horizontal) on specific DOM elements, effectively resolving pixel phase misalignment issues.

Non-intrusive UX: Implement a grid overlay that allows full "click-through" interaction, ensuring users can inspect the grid while simultaneously manipulating DevTools or interacting with the web interface without obstruction.

Smart Measurement: Provide an on-demand pixel deviation measurement tool (delta) to quickly detect minor misalignment errors (1-2px).

Workflow Optimization: Eliminate visual distraction by rendering the grid only on the selected element (Active Container) rather than the entire viewport.

1.2 Background Context

In modern web interface development, especially within the WordPress ecosystem, components are often designed as nested modules. A significant pain point is the "Global Grid Fallacy": a global 14px grid anchored to the <body> often misaligns when applied to a child component with odd coordinates (e.g., a top offset of 13px), rendering "pixel-perfect" checks impossible.

Furthermore, existing tools often hijack mouse events (blocking interactions), forcing developers to constantly toggle the tool on and off to interact with the underlying elements. "WP 14px Rhythm Inspector" is conceived as a lightweight Chrome Extension utilizing a "Local Square Grid" mechanism anchored directly to the element's padding-box, helping developers maintain design rhythm without disrupting their workflow.
