3. User Interface Design Goals

3.1 Overall UX Vision

Minimalist, Utilitarian, "Invisible". The user interface must not compete for attention with the web content. It operates as a technical "heads-up display" (HUD) layer that appears only when necessary.

3.2 Key Interaction Paradigms

Activation: Click the Extension icon on the browser toolbar.

Discovery: Hover to see a Blue Outline around available DOM elements.

Locking: Left-click to pin the grid to the element. Any previously active grid disappears (Single Instance rule).

Measurement: Hold the Alt key to trigger temporary measurement mode. Release to exit.

3.3 Core Screens and Views

Selection State: Light Blue Outline surrounding the hovered element.

Active Grid Overlay: 14x14px Grid (Cyan/Magenta, 30% opacity) overlaying the selected element.

Measurement Tooltip: A small floating information box displaying delta coordinates (e.g., x: +2px, y: 0) appearing next to the cursor while Alt is held.

3.4 Accessibility

Standard: WCAG AA (for contrast of grid lines and tooltip text).

Color Blindness: Support default high-contrast colors (Cyan/Magenta) that are visible on both light and dark backgrounds.

3.5 Branding

Style: "Technical Blueprint" aesthetic.

Primary Colors: Cyan (#00FFFF) or Magenta (#FF00FF) to ensure visibility on the majority of web designs.

3.6 Target Device and Platforms

Desktop Chrome/Chromium Only: Due to the nature of development tools and hover/shortcut interactions, the MVP supports Desktop only.
