6. Epic Details

6.1 Epic 1: Foundation & Core Grid Injection

Expanded Goal: Establish a functional Chrome Extension architecture (Manifest V3), implement the mechanism for discovering and selecting target DOM elements, and display a 14px grid overlay (CSS/SVG) accurately pinned to the element without blocking user interaction.

6.1.1 Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Manifest V3 Setup

User Story: As a Developer, I want a functional extension build system using Vite and Manifest V3 so that I can develop the extension according to modern standards.

Acceptance Criteria:

npm run build command generates a dist folder containing a valid manifest.json (V3) and bundled JS files for background and content scripts.

The extension loads into Chrome Developer Mode (Load Unpacked) without errors.

The extension has a simple Popup or Toolbar Icon that functions.

Content Script runs on any web page and logs "WP Inspector Ready" to the console.

6.1.2 Story 1.2: Element Discovery & Highlighting

User Story: As a User, I want to see a highlight effect when hovering over page elements so that I know exactly which element will be selected for the grid.

Acceptance Criteria:

Hovering over a DOM element displays a Blue Outline around it.

Moving the mouse away removes the blue outline.

Performance must be smooth without lag when moving quickly over nested elements (requires throttling/debouncing or requestAnimationFrame).

Only visible elements with real dimensions are highlighted (ignore hidden or 0x0 px elements).

6.1.3 Story 1.3: Grid Overlay Injection (The "Lock")

User Story: As a User, I want to click on a highlighted element to "pin" (lock) the 14px grid to it so that I can inspect alignment.

Acceptance Criteria:

A click event on a highlighted element triggers grid generation.

The grid is rendered inside a Shadow DOM host attached to (or overlaying) the target element to ensure style isolation.

The Grid Pattern consists of 14px x 14px squares.

The Grid Origin (0,0) must align exactly with the top-left corner of the target element's Padding Box.

If another grid is already visible elsewhere, it must be removed before the new grid appears (Single Instance Rule).

6.1.4 Story 1.4: Click-Through Transparency

User Story: As a Developer, I want to be able to click and interact with elements beneath the grid layer so that my workflow is not interrupted.

Acceptance Criteria:

The container holding the grid must have the CSS property pointer-events: none.

Users can click buttons, links, or form inputs located beneath the grid.

Users can select text located beneath the grid.

Users can right-click to open the Chrome Context Menu on elements beneath the grid (Inspect Element).

6.2 Epic 2: Smart Measurement & Polish

Expanded Goal: Implement the Smart Measurement tool to help developers detect precise pixel deviations, optimize application performance, and finalize necessary assets for the final product packaging.

6.2.1 Story 2.1: Measurement Core Logic (The Brain)

User Story: As a Developer, I want the system to calculate the distance from the mouse cursor to the nearest grid line when I activate measurement mode so that I know my deviation in pixels.

Acceptance Criteria:

Calculation logic runs only when the Alt key is held (keydown) and stops immediately upon release (keyup).

The system captures mouse coordinates (Mouse X, Y) relative to the Active Container.

Delta Calculation Formula:

Distance to nearest vertical line = MouseX % 14. If result > 7, Delta is negative (distance to the next line).

Output is an object { deltaX, deltaY } updated continuously on mouse move.

6.2.2 Story 2.2: Measurement Tooltip UI (The Face)

User Story: As a User, I want to see a small tooltip following my mouse cursor displaying the Delta values so that I can read the results immediately without looking away.

Acceptance Criteria:

Display a Tooltip containing text formatted as x: +2px, y: -1px.

Tooltip must reside inside the Shadow DOM to remain unaffected by the page CSS.

Tooltip position always stays next to the mouse cursor (with a 10-15px offset) to avoid obscuring the measurement point.

Tooltip automatically hides when the user releases the Alt key.

6.2.3 Story 2.3: Performance Optimization & Polish

User Story: As a User, I want the tool to operate smoothly even when I scroll the page or resize the window, without consuming excessive browser RAM.

Acceptance Criteria:

Use requestAnimationFrame for all mousemove events in measurement mode.

Handle scroll and resize events: The grid and measurement area must maintain correct positioning relative to the target element (or automatically recalculate position).

Cleanup: Ensure all Event Listeners are removed when the Extension is disabled or switched to another element to avoid Memory Leaks.

6.2.4 Story 2.4: Packaging & Assets Preparation

User Story: As a Product Owner, I want a complete set of installation files and image assets so that I can upload to the Chrome Web Store or distribute to testers.

Acceptance Criteria:

Complete set of standard Icon sizes (16, 32, 48, 128px).

Complete manifest.json file with metadata (name, description, version).

npm run package command (or equivalent) generates a .zip file containing the optimized production build (minified code).
