2. Requirements

2.1 Functional Requirements

FR1 - Targeted Activation: The user activates the extension and hovers to highlight DOM elements. Upon clicking an element, a 14px grid is "pinned" to that element (Active Container), resetting the origin coordinates (0,0) to the top-left corner of the element's padding-box.

FR2 - Grid Visualization: The grid must be rendered as fixed 14px x 14px squares. Lines should be 1px wide, using a high-contrast color (Cyan/Magenta) with approximately 30-50% opacity. The grid must scroll naturally with the element's content (absolute positioning relative to the container).

FR3 - Transparent Interaction: The grid overlay container must possess the CSS property pointer-events: none. All clicks, text selection, or drag operations must pass through the grid to the underlying web element.



2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1 - Performance: Measurement logic must remain idle by default. When active (Alt key held), mousemove event handlers must be throttled using requestAnimationFrame to ensure optimal frame rates.

NFR2 - Isolation: Extension UI components (tooltips, toggle buttons) must be rendered within a Shadow DOM to prevent CSS bleeding (style conflicts) from the host page.

NFR3 - Tech Stack Constraints: Utilize Vanilla JavaScript (no heavy frameworks) to minimize the injection footprint. Adhere to Chrome Extension Manifest V3 architecture.

NFR4 - Platform Scope: Support Desktop Chrome/Chromium browsers only. Mobile support is out of scope for the MVP.

NFR5 - Configurable Unit: Grid size should be configurable (default 14px). UI for custom sizing will be provided in Epic 3.
