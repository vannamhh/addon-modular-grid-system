4. Technical Assumptions

4.1 Repository Structure

Single Repo (Monorepo style): Small project containing the entire extension source code.

/src: Main source code (Background scripts, Content scripts, Popup UI).

/assets: Icons, images.

/dist or /build: Output after build (using bundler).

4.2 Service Architecture

Client-side Only: The extension operates independently within the user's browser. No backend server, database, or external API calls (except potential future telemetry, excluded from MVP).

Communication: Utilize Chrome Messaging API for communication between popup (if any), background service worker (state management), and content script (DOM/Grid manipulation).

4.3 Testing Requirements

Unit Testing: Mandatory for calculation logic functions (measurement logic). Use Jest or Vitest.

Manual Testing: Due to the highly visual nature, manual testing on actual WordPress sites is paramount.

No E2E Automation (MVP): Cypress/Selenium setup is deferred for this phase to save time.

4.4 Additional Technical Assumptions

Build Tool: Use Vite to bundle code. Although using Vanilla JS, Vite improves Developer Experience (DX) with modules, hot-reload, and production file optimization.

Manifest Version: Mandatory Manifest V3.

Permissions: Minimize permissions; request only activeTab to ensure privacy and facilitate Store approval.
